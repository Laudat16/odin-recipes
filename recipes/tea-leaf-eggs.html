        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Tea eggs are one of my favorite dishes and traditional lucky food to make for the Lunar New Year. These hard-boiled eggs are <br>subtly flavored with anise and have a deep brown hue from black tea and soy. The marbled patterns from the cracked shells make <br>these quite attractive. I eat them chilled and sliced in quarters as a side dish, appetizer, or snack.</p>

        <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups water</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon black soysauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tangerine zest</li>
            <li>1 (2 inch) pieace of cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>2 pods star anise</li>
            <li>1 1/4 tablespoons salt, divided</li>
            <li>8 large eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <li>Combine 3 cups water, tea leaves, soy sauce, black soy sauce, zest, cinnamon stick, star anise, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large saucepan; <br>bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place eggs and remaining 1 teaspoon salt into a medium pot; cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer <br>for 20 minutes. Remove from heat, drain, and cool. Tap cooled eggs with the back of a spoon to crack shells; do not remove shells.</li>
